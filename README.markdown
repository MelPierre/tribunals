MoJ Tribunals
=============

A Ruby on Rails application for giving public access to UK Tribunal decisions.

This application requires 'soffice', a binary that comes with libreoffice.

Installing libreoffice on OSX

Download and install the standard LibreOffice application. You will need to add the binaries to your path though. Simply add this line to the bottom of your ~/.bash_profile and then re-open your terminal.

> export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/"

Installing libreoffice on Ubuntu
--------------------------------

Should be as simple as:

> sudo aptitude install libreoffice
